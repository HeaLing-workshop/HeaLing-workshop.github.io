## üß† Workshop Scope

Language-oriented approaches‚Äîsuch as discourse and conversation analysis, narrative medicine, and linguistic ethnography‚Äîhave long been central to qualitative investigations of how medical knowledge is produced, communicated, and experienced.  

Today, advances in **natural language processing (NLP)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** offer new possibilities for extending and scaling linguistic approaches across large health-related datasets.

The **HeaLing** workshop invites contributions that integrate qualitative and computational methods to examine how language informs and transforms medicine as a social and scientific practice. A central focus of the workshop is the practical value of interpretive insights derived from language analysis.

We welcome researchers from **medical humanities**, **social and historical studies of medicine**, and **computational language sciences**.  
The workshop will be held as a **half-day event** at EACL 2026.

## üß© Topics of Interest (include but are not limited to)

- Computational + qualitative discourse analysis of clinical, scientific, policy, and other health-related texts (media, guidelines, patient narratives, clinical notes).  
- Metaphor and framing in illness narratives, public health messaging, and clinical communication.  
- Narrative medicine, story-centered clinical interventions, and evaluation of their effects.  
- Historical and contemporary discourse studies of medical epistemologies (how concepts, categories, and expertise are constructed).  
- Language, power, and inequality: how linguistic framing shapes access, stigma, and policy for marginalized populations.  
- Methods for responsible use of NLP/LLMs in medical language research (bias, explainability, mixed-methods validation).  
- Digital humanities approaches: building and interrogating historical corpora, archives, and born-digital records.  
- Translational impact: case studies showing how interpretive linguistic insights led to concrete changes in practice, education, or policy.
